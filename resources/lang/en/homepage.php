    'label_symptoms_of_incorrect_work_of_freezer'=>"Symptoms of a faulty refrigerator",
    'label_symptoms_deffinition'=>"A key indicator that something is wrong with your freezer is that it makes strange noises – for example, if the usual quiet hum turns into a furious buzz, or if it suddenly starts making gurgling, whistling, or buzzing noises. If you hear unusual sounds from the freezer and any warning lights that may be installed by your make and model also show, then it's time to call a professional repairman to make a diagnosis. Another sign of trouble is when a large accumulation of ice forms in the freezer or on the back of the refrigerator – even on the door hinges. Or you may find that your refrigerator is sitting in a puddle, and it is not clear where the leak is coming from. The obvious problem is that the refrigerator's freezer simply doesn't cool down and doesn't maintain the desired temperature, even if you set it to the coldest available temperature. All these things are relatively easy to investigate and repair, replacing worn parts if necessary, but if you don't call experts, these symptoms are probably a harbinger of a complete refrigerator breakdown that will leave you facing the expense of buying a new appliance. In most cases, an overhaul can fix your refrigerator-freezer much cheaper than replacing it, giving it a new lease of life no matter what the fault is. However, if it is beyond repair, we can provide you with a new refrigerator-freezer at a very competitive price from our Euronics store, and if you want to try DIY refrigerator-freezer repair, we stock up on spare parts available for mail order.
